GOID: GO:0002460
Term: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune
    receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
Ontology: BP
Definition: An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing specific
    receptors for antigen produced through a somatic diversification process
    that includes somatic recombination of germline gene segments encoding
    immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen encoded
    by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and
    immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with
    antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great
    magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo
    clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory
    cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells
    generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger
    secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen
    (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response
    found in Mus musculus.

    metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors
    located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located
    within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is

Ontology: BP
Definition: An intracellular signaling cassette characterized by the
    I-kappaB-kinase (IKK)-dependent activation of NF-kappaB, also known as the
    canonical NF-kappaB signaling cascade. The cascade begins with activation of
    a trimeric IKK complex (consisting of catalytic kinase subunits IKKalpha
    and/or IKKbeta, and the regulatory scaffold protein NEMO) and ends with the
    regulation of transcription of target genes by NF-kappaB. In a resting
    state, NF-kappaB dimers are bound to I-kappaB proteins, sequestering
    NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of I-kappaB targets I-kappaB for
    ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus releasing the NF-kappaB
    dimers, which can translocate to the nucleus to bind DNA and regulate
    transcription. The canonical NF-kappaB pathway is mainly stimulated by
    proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor
    (TNF)-alpha, antigen ligands, and toll-like receptors (TLRs).

    (activating transcription factor 4), which up regulates a subset of UPR
    genes required to restore folding capacity.

    responsive cells. All chemokines possess a number of conserved cysteine
    residues involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation. Some
    chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an
    immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of
    infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in
    controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue
    maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some
    viruses and some bacteria.
